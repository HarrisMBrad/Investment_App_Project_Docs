# IBG SHADOW TRADING
* @KnightsOfAvalon
This repository includes the planning files for the investment app called "IBG Shadow Trading". This app is being created for a group project for IBG students.

To view the source code for this app (when we have started writing code), please see the [code repository](https://github.com/KnightsOfAvalon/Investment_App_Code) for this project.

## Overview of Project (current as of 2/27/2021)

This project is still in the very early stages of development. Most details are subject to change. The following is an overview of the most current group concensus on major aspects of the project. Please feel free to propose changes.

### 1. App Features

Please see the "Functional Requirements List for Minimum Viable Product.txt" file for up-to-date information about the minimum features the app needs to have.
Please see the "Functional Requirements List for Finished Product_NOT MVP.txt" file for up-to-date information about features the Investment App should have upon completion.
These are both working documents, so expect them to change frequently.
Documentation files are .txt versions that can be easily viewed in a text editor.

### 2. Where Will App Data be Stored?

The plan is for application data to be stored in a database using services provided by AWS Amplify. Specific details are still TBD.

### 3. Security

The plan is to incorporate two-factor authentication and encryption of data using services provided by AWS Amplify. Specific details are still TBD.

### 4. Biometrics

At this point, we are planning for this app to only have a web version (no mobile version). There is no plan to incorporate biometrics for the web version.
We would like to create a mobile version at some point, but we are focusing on a web version for now.

### 5. Testing

The plan is to write our own tests.
Other tools and methods for automated testing will be researched and implemented if practical.

### 6. Building and Deploying (CI/CD Pipeline)

To Be Discussed

### 7. Where Are the Services Going to be Hosted?

The plan is for services to be hosted by AWS, specifically using the product called AWS Amplify.

### 8. Notifications

The plan is for notifications to be implemented through services provided by AWS Amplify.

### 9. Code Cleaning/LINTing

To Be Discussed

### 10. App Systems Architecture

To Be Discussed

### 11. Component Level Design

To Be Discussed

### 12. Agile Tools/Jira/Bitbucket

We plan on using Jira to track team workflow. We are working on gaining access to a Jira workspace via IBG. After we gain access, planning documentation, code, and code documentation for this app will most likely be maintained on BitBucket.
